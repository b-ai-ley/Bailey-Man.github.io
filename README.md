## Projects

<!-- <img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> **[Customer Survival Analysis and Churn Prediction](https://github.com/archd3sai/Customer-Survival-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction)** -->

In this project I have used survival analysis to study how the likelihood of the customer churn changes over time. I have also implementd a Random Forest model to predict the customer churn and deployed a model using flask webapp on Heroku. [App](https://churn-prediction-app.herokuapp.com/)  

## Micro Projects
- ### Statistics and Machine Learning
    # - [Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/archd3sai/Statistical-Methods/blob/master/genetic-algorithm.ipynb) : In this file, I have implemented simple genetic algorithm that finds out the list of numbers which equal to any specified number when summed together.
    
- ### Challenges
    # - [SQL Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/SQL): This repository contains codes of online SQL challenges (From Hackerrank, Leetcode, Testdome, etc.) solved by me.
    # - [Data Science Challenges](https://github.com/archd3sai/DS-Challenges): This repository contains codes of online Data Science challenges (From Hackerrank, TestDome, etc.) solved by me.
    
- ### Ranking Algorithms
    # - [Ranking of NFL teams using Markov-chain methods](https://github.com/archd3sai/Ranking-of-NFL-Teams-using-Markov-method/blob/master/Ranking%20of%20NFL%20teams%20Report.pdf) : In this project I implemented and compared three stationary distribution of Markov-chain based approaches to rank 32 NFL (National Football League) teams from "Best" to "Worst" using the scores of 2007 NFL regular season.
    # - [Ranking of Tennis players](https://github.com/archd3sai/Tennis-Players-Ranking/blob/master/TennisRanking.ipynb) : Objective of this project is to rank all Tennis Players based on the matches they played in the year of 2018. This project comprises 4 approaches to rank Tennis players and I have tried to make these approaches more robust sequentially.
